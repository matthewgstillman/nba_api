more endangered than this one. The incumbent, Rick Nolan, barely won in 2016 and is not seeking another term. The expansive district, which stretches from the Minneapolis exurbs through the mining towns of the Iron Range, is heavily unionized, and for decades it was solidly Democratic territory. But President Trump is very popular — he carried the district by 16 percentage points — and his trade policies have lifted the region’s iron mines.\n\nPete Stauber, a county commissioner and former Duluth police lieutenant, is the Trump-endorsed Republican candidate.

Republican, are competing to fill the seat Ms. Rosen vacated to run for senate. The district is drawn to be “fair fight” terrain, with almost equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans. Mr. Tarkanian originally intended to challenge Mr. Heller in the Republican Senate primary, until President Trump intervened and persuaded him to run for Ms. Rosen’s seat instead.\n\nMr. Tarkanian is a perennial candidate who has run in the past for seats in the Senate, House of Representatives and State Senate. A real estate investor and former college basketball star, he has molded himself in Mr. Trump’s image in this race, promoting an “America First” approach. Ms. Lee, the founder of several nonprofit groups, has significantly <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/races/summary?cycle=2018&id=NV03\">outraised</a> Mr. Tarkanian in campaign funds, and the nonpartisan Cook Political Report gives her the advantage.","seat":3,"seat_name":"District 3","state_id":"NV","state_slug":"nevada","party_id":"","has_incumbent":false,"uncontested":false,"report":true,"result":"winner","result_source":"AP","gain":false,"lost_seat":"","votes":286061,"poll_display":"Polls close at 10 p.m. Eastern time.","poll_time":"2018-11-06T22:00:00.000Z","precincts_reporting":424,"precincts_total":424,"reporting_display":"100% reporting","rating":"Lean D","incumbent_party":"democrat","no_forecast":false,"candidates":[{"candidate_id":"lee-65174","candidate_key":"lees","first_name":"Susie","last_name":"Lee","order":1,"name_display":"Susie Lee","party_id":"democrat","incumbent":false,"runoff":false,"winner":true,"votes":148436,"percent":51.9,"percent_display":"51.9"},{"candidate_id":"tarkanian-60365","candidate_key":"tarkaniand","first_name":"Danny","last_name":"Tarkanian","order":1,"name_display":"Danny Tarkanian","party_id":"republican","incumbent":false,"runoff":false,"winner":false,"votes":122527,"percent":42.8,"percent_display":"42.8"},{"candidate_id":"brown-62080","candidate_key":"browns","first_name":"Steve","last_name":"Brown","order":"3","name_display":"Steve Brown","party_id":"libertarian","incumbent":false,"runoff":false,"winner":false,"votes":4554,"percent":1.6,"percent_display":"1.6"},{"candidate_id":"goossen-64034","candidate_key":"goossend","first_name":"David","last_name":"Goossen","order":"5","name_display":"David Goossen","party_id":"independent","incumbent":false,"runoff":false,"winner":false,"votes":3627,"percent":1.3,"percent_display":"1.3"},{"candidate_id":"vickers-67687","candidate_key":"vickersh","first_name":"Harry","last_name":"Vickers","order":"7","name_display":"Harry Vickers","party_id":"independent-american","incumbent":false,"runoff":false,"winner":false,"votes":3479,"percent":1.2,"percent_display":"1.2"},{"candidate_id":"eisner-6994","candidate_key":"eisnerg","first_name":"Gil","last_name":"Eisner","order":"4","name_display":"Gil Eisner","party_id":"independent","incumbent":false,"runoff":false,"winner":false,"votes":1887,"percent":0.7,"percent_display":"0.7"},{"candidate_id":"gumina-65518","candidate_key":"guminat","first_name":"Tony","last_name":"Gumina","order":"6","name_display":"Tony Gumina","party_id":"independent","incumbent":false,"runoff":false,"winner":false,"votes":1551,"percent":0.5,"percent_display":"0.5"}],"counties":[{"fips":"32003","name":"Clark","votes":286061,"reporting":424,"precincts":424,"results":{"lees":148436,"tarkaniand":122527,"browns":4554,"goossend":3627,"vickersh":3479,"eisnerg":1887,"guminat":1551}}]},{"race_id":"nv-30992-2018-11-06","race_slug":"nv-house-general-district-004-2018-11-06","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/nevada-house-district-4","race_type":"house","election_type":"general","election_date":"2018-11-06","runoff":false,"race_name":"U.S. House District 4","office":"U.S. House","nyt_rating":2,"race_call_note":"","race_text":"","nyt_measure_title":"","nyt_title":"","nyt_race_description":"This seat fell open when the Democratic incumbent, Representative Ruben Kihuen, decided not to seek re-election after two women <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/ruben-kihuen-harassment.html\">accused him</a> of sexual harassment.

York, which President Trump won by 25 percentage points, was thrown into disarray in August when the Republican incumbent, Chris Collins, was charged with insider trading. At first he said he would withdraw from the race, but he resumed  campaigning in mid-September, and polls suggest a close contest with Nate McMurray, the Democratic town supervisor of Grand Island. Both candidates are white, but the race took on a racial tinge when Mr. Collins ran an attack ad showing Mr. McMurray, a lawyer who worked in South Korea for a time, speaking Korean.","seat":27,"seat_name":"District 27","state_id":"NY","state_slug":"new-york","party_id":"","has_incumbent":true,"uncontested":false,"report":true,"result":"","result_source":"AP","gain":false,"lost_seat":"","votes":271365,"poll_display":"Polls close at 9 p.m. Eastern time.","poll_time":"2018-11-06T21:00:00.000Z","precincts_reporting":603,"precincts_total":603,"reporting_display":"100% reporting","rating":"Lean R","incumbent_party":"republican","no_forecast":false,"candidates":[{"candidate_id":"collins-62324","candidate_key":"collinsc","first_name":"Chris","last_name":"Collins","order":1,"name_display":"Chris Collins","party_id":"republican","incumbent":true,"runoff":false,"winner":false,"votes":134251,"percent":49.5,"percent_display":"49.5"},{"candidate_id":"mcmurray-67142","candidate_key":"mcmurrayn","first_name":"Nate","last_name":"McMurray","order":1,"name_display":"Nate McMurray","party_id":"democrat","incumbent":false,"runoff":false,"winner":false,"votes":131341,"percent":48.4,"percent_display":"48.4"},{"candidate_id":"piegza-67143","candidate_key":"piegzal","first_name":"Larry","last_name":"Piegza","order":"7","name_display":"Larry Piegza","party_id":"reform","incumbent":false,"runoff":false,"winner":false,"votes":5773,"percent":2.1,"percent_display":"2.1"}],"counties":[{"fips":"36029","name":"Erie","votes":117872,"reporting":216,"precincts":216,"results":{"mcmurrayn":60409,"collinsc":55103,"piegzal":2360}},{"fips":"36037","name":"Genesee","votes":19733,"reporting":53,"precincts":53,"results":{"collinsc":10986,"mcmurrayn":8149,"piegzal":598}},{"fips":"36051","name":"Livingston","votes":23940,"reporting":61,"precincts":61,"results":{"collinsc":11982,"mcmurrayn":11433,"piegzal":525}},{"fips":"36055","name":"Monroe","votes":11547,"reporting":29,"precincts":29,"results":{"mcmurrayn":5727,"collinsc":5619,"piegzal":201}},{"fips":"36063","name":"Niagara","votes":46520,"reporting":112,"precincts":112,"results":{"collinsc":23093,"mcmurrayn":22393,"piegzal":1034}},{"fips":"36069","name":"Ontario","votes":26456,"reporting":52,"precincts":52,"results":{"mcmurrayn":14117,"collinsc":11918,"piegzal":421}},{"fips":"36073","name":"Orleans","votes":12060,"reporting":40,"precincts":40,"results":{"collinsc":7269,"mcmurrayn":4505,"piegzal":286}},{"fips":"36121","name":"Wyoming","votes":13237,"reporting":40,"precincts":40,"results":{"collinsc":8281,"mcmurrayn":4608,"piegzal":348}}]},{"race_id":"ny-39760-2018-11-06","race_slug":"ny-governor-general-2018-11-06","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/new-york-governor","race_type":"governor","election_type":"general","election_date":"2018-11-06","runoff":false,"race_name":"Governor","office":"Governor","race_call_note":"","race_text":"","nyt_measure_title":"","nyt_title":"","seat":"","seat_name":"","state_id":"NY","state_slug":"new-york","party_id":"","has_incumbent":true,"uncontested":false,"report":true,"result":"winner","result_source":"AP","gain":false,"lost_seat":"","votes":5689207,"poll_display":"Polls close at 9 p.m. Eastern time.","poll_time":"2018-11-06T21:00:00.000Z","precincts_reporting":15543,"precincts_total":15598,"reporting_display":"99% reporting","incumbent_party":"democrat","no_forecast":false,"candidates":[{"candidate_id":"cuomo-1506","candidate_key":"cuomoa","first_name":"Andrew M.","last_name":"Cuomo","order":1,"name_display":"Andrew M.
